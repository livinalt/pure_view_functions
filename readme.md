# Math Operations Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract, `MathOperations`, provides basic mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and the ability to update a result variable. The contract is designed to illustrate the usage of `view` and `pure` in Solidity.


## Requirements

Solidity Compiler ^0.8.22


## Contract Details

### MathOperations

State variable `result` stores the result of mathematical operations.
Constructor initializes the `result` variable to 0.
`add(uint a, uint b)`: A `view` function for addition operations.
`multiply(uint a, uint b)`: A `pure` function for multiplication operations.
`updateResult(uint newValue)`: A non-constant function to update the `result` variable.

## Use

```solidity
// Deploy the MathOperations contract
MathOperations mathOps = new MathOperations();

// Perform addition
uint additionResult = mathOps.add(3, 5); // Result should be 8

// Perform multiplication
uint multiplicationResult = mathOps.multiply(4, 6); // Result should be 24

// Update the result variable
mathOps.updateResult(42);
uint updatedResult = mathOps.result(); // Result should be 42
```
